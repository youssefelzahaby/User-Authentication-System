# 🛡️ User Authentication System

A complete user authentication system built using **Django** as part of my journey to learn back-end development.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a simple yet functional **Login & Signup system**, allowing users to register and log in using their credentials. It stores data securely in the database using Django’s built-in ORM.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

My main goal was to learn Django and understand how to build real-world back-end systems.  
Through this project, I explored how Django handles views, models, templates, and form data.

---

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Django fundamentals (views, models, templates, URL routing)
- Handling form data with POST requests
- Using **Django Template Language (DTL)** to render dynamic content
- Connecting front-end templates with back-end logic
- Integrating a pre-designed front-end template and customizing it (I have front-end experience)
- Storing user data using Django ORM
